VHP: This is the code for implementing the VHP proposed by Zhaohong Sun: 'Towards Predictive Analysis on Disease Progression: A Variational Hawkes Process
Based Model'.
## 
Baseline Models:
###### 
(1) AED  
(2) AED_Hawkes  
(3) AED_Time_1  
(4) AED_Time_2  
(5) AED_Time_3  
(6) AED_Hawkes_GAN

(1) VAE  
(2) VAE_Hawkes  
(3) VAE_Time_1  
(4) VAE_Time_2  
(5) VAE_Time_3  
(6) VHP (Proposed)

## 
Datasets:
####
Three datasets are used for validation, which are sepsis from MIMIC-III, HF from MIMIC-III and HF from PLA Hospital. Among them, the HF from MIMIC-III has been released in https://github.com/ZJU-BMI/Medical-Trajectory-Generation/tree/master/dataset_file.
