Datasets:
####
Three datasets are used for validation, which are: 
1) MIMIC-III Sepsis dataset:  We extracted this dataset following https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/AIClinician/AIClinician.
2) MIMIC-III HF dataset: The pre-processed dataset has been released in https://github.com/ZJU-BMI/Medical-Trajectory-Generation/tree/master/dataset_file
3) PLA dataset: private.
